In this English for Developers Curriculum, you'll learn the essentials of English communication. This will follow the A2 level of the Common European Framework of Reference (CEFR). And we've focused on vocabulary that is particularly useful for developers.

The first half of the curriculum will help you get comfortable with English grammar and usage. It will give you tons of hands-on practice. You'll learn basics like introducing yourself, making small talk, and discussing your work.

In the second half, you'll practice vocabulary specific to software development. You'll learn how to describe code, discuss tech trends, and participate in stand-up meetings.

This entire A2-level curriculum includes 105 different dialogues. Each is designed to build your vocabulary and boost your confidence when speaking in a professional tech setting.
